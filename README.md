# LearningSummary

### Sql vs NoSql
Structural query language (SQL) is a domain specific Lange(DSL) designed for relational database manage system (RDBMS)

Relational database bases on relational model of data, and was proposed by E.F.Codd in 1970. It was invented back than and fit well with the data access pattern.

Storage efficient was important as the cost was high (however, storage cost lowers as Moore's law), and online analysis processing was favoring a query engine that allows performer to look up data from any angles

Couple of comparisons

* Relational db provides structural data, and therefore reduces data duplication
* There are 5 level of normal forms, which help tp normalize data model in relational database
* Relational db allows data lookup from any angel, whereas NoSql lookup requires a pre-plan out for the data model based on access pattern
* NoSql db access data with a partition key, which tells where to find the data quickly therefore can be scaled up horizontally
* Partition key helps locate the physical data center. With a B+ tree, compute complexity is O(logn)
* Relational database is not easy to scale as JOIN operation is time expensive as size goes larger and larger

### Hash Ring
* Hash ring favors consistent hashing, meaning less re-shuffled when it comes to node deletion/addition
* K-position scatting is used to avoid uneven distribution of nodes. Results in k times re-shuffles when adding/deleting a new node
* Replication is used to improve availability. When hash looking up, next node becomes next N nodes.
* Eventual consistency provides faster read/write. For highest throughput, set W and R to be 1, meaning as long as one node performs operation successfully, return

### B+ tree
* m-way search tree has at most m children with m-1 keys
* m-way ST becomes B tree when a root has at least 2 children and other nodes has at least m/2 children, in the meantime, tree would be constructed bottom up (making sure all leaf at the same level)
* B tree becomes B+ tree when each node has its presents in the leaf, leaf are linked and only leaf has pointers to the record (disk block).
* B+ tree is used to optimize disk-based storage indexing. (A data-structure represents multi-level indexing )
* B+ tree has leaf nodes linked for faster range operations
* Direct lookup takes O(logn) compute complexity

### Spring MVC
* Spring MVC takes in http request in DispatchServlet (single entry point)
* DispatchServlet has WebApplicationContext spawned when server spins up
* DispatchServlet will dispatch requests to individual controller
* DispatchServlet is essentially a java servlet, which opens a java socket bonded to a certain port
* DispatchServlet acts as proxy so that it loads requests to RestController in different url path
* Root context is used by controllers, whereas WebApplicationContext is used by front controller (DispatchServlet)
* RestController returns data in textual format, whereas Controller returns the data to a ViewResolver

### Service discovery vs load balancer
* Service discovery acts like a facade to provide endpoints of services to make endpoint changes easier
* Service discovery provides ability to provide client cache
* load balancer acts as dispatcher to dispatch requests to servers to make node addition/deletion easier

### Spring transactional
* TBD

### Java memory model 
* Java source code will be compiled by javac(java compiler) into .class hexadecimal files
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) will take .class files. Classloader loads classes into JVM in runtime
* We all know static fields are stored into JVM heap instead of stack (each thread has its own stack) memory
* Static fields points to the same reference in heap, however there is no guarantee of the visibility for all threads to see the changes
* java volatile is used to make sure data is written into main memory and visibility to all threads
