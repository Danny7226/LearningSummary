## Topics
### Sql vs NoSql
Structural query language (SQL) is a domain specific Lange(DSL) designed for relational database manage system (RDBMS)

Relational database bases on relational model of data, and was proposed by E.F.Codd in 1970. It was invented back than and fit well with the data access pattern.

Storage efficient was important as the cost was high (however, storage cost lowers as Moore's law), and online analysis processing was favoring a query engine that allows performer to look up data from any angles

Couple of comparisons

* Relational db provides structural data, and therefore reduces data duplication
* There are 5 level of normal forms, which help tp normalize data model in relational database
* Relational db allows data lookup from any angel, whereas NoSql lookup requires a pre-plan out for the data model based on access pattern
* NoSql db access data with a partition key, which tells where to find the data quickly therefore can be scaled up horizontally
* Partition key helps locate the physical data center. With a B+ tree, compute complexity is O(logn)
* Relational database is not easy to scale as JOIN operation is time expensive as size goes larger and larger

### Hash Ring
* Hash ring favors consistent hashing, meaning less re-shuffled when it comes to node deletion/addition
* K-position scatting is used to avoid uneven distribution of nodes. Results in k times re-shuffles when adding/deleting a new node
* Replication is used to improve availability. When hash looking up, next node becomes next N nodes.
* Eventual consistency provides faster read/write. For highest throughput, set W and R to be 1, meaning as long as one node performs operation successfully, return

### B+ tree
* m-way search tree has at most m children with m-1 keys
* m-way ST becomes B tree when a root has at least 2 children and other nodes has at least m/2 children, in the meantime, tree would be constructed bottom up (making sure all leaf at the same level)
* B tree becomes B+ tree when each node has its presents in the leaf, leaf are linked and only leaf has pointers to the record (disk block).
* B+ tree is used to optimize disk-based storage indexing. (A data-structure represents multi-level indexing )
* B+ tree has leaf nodes linked for faster range operations
* Direct lookup takes O(logn) compute complexity

### Spring MVC
* Spring MVC takes in http request in DispatchServlet (single entry point)
* DispatchServlet has WebApplicationContext spawned when server spins up
* DispatchServlet will dispatch requests to individual controller
* DispatchServlet is essentially a java servlet, which opens a java socket bonded to a certain port
* DispatchServlet acts as proxy so that it loads requests to RestController in different url path
* Root context is used by controllers, whereas WebApplicationContext is used by front controller (DispatchServlet)
* RestController returns data in textual format, whereas Controller returns the data to a ViewResolver

### Service discovery vs load balancer
* Service discovery acts like a facade to provide endpoints of services to make endpoint changes easier
* Service discovery provides ability to provide client cache
* load balancer acts as dispatcher to dispatch requests to servers to make node addition/deletion easier

### Spring transactional
* TBD

### Java memory model 
* https://medium.com/platform-engineer/understanding-java-memory-model-1d0863f6d973
* Java source code will be compiled by javac(java compiler) into .class files
* .class files are data in bytecode format in binary. People might think it's hexadecimal, but it's actually not. Hexadecimal representation is just a way of viewing binary data
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) will take .class files. Classloader loads classes into JVM in runtime
* Classloader doesn't change the format of data, it simply loads files into memory
* Bytecode is platform independent, meaning it can be executed in any compatible JVM platforms. (Windows, Linux, OSX have different implementations of JVM, JVM acts as an abstract layer between bytecode and hardware OS)
* We all know static fields are stored into JVM heap instead of stack (each thread has its own stack) memory
* Even within threads, thread creates local objects, which are only visible to themselves. Note that these local objects also stored in heap instead of stack
* Thread maintains a reference in stack pointing to the actual object in heap
* Java garbage collection scans heap memory and cleans objects that are no longer referenced
* Static fields points to the same reference in heap, and therefore multiple threads accessing same static class/method/fields might cause race condition. However there is no guarantee of the visibility for all threads to see the changes
* java volatile is used to make sure data is written into main memory and visibility to all threads

### Weaving
* Weaving is a technical to manipulate byte-code java classes in JVM 
* Compile time weaving happens when javac compiles .java into .class
* Post-compile weaving happens to .class files
* Load-time weaving in AOP happens when java class loader loads classes files into JVM
* Runtime weaving happens in JVM (after class loader has loaded .classes files into JVM). (***Quesiton, relation to java agent?***) 
* Spring AOP uses a proxy based runtime weaving
* Compile time weaving cannot defer decision in runtime, but is better to debug to know problems fast
* Post-compile weaving works well with 3rd party code, which developers don't have source code of in general
* Load-time weaving introduce extra overhead when JVM/application starts up, or server spins up (as class loader needs to spend extra time to weave when loading classes into JVM)
* However, LTW provides feasibility to decide if/what to weave
* Load-time weaving keeps source code free of aspect related code (so that LTW are used at certain time not all time, say performance monitoring and debugging runtime) https://github.com/indrabasak/spring-loadtime-weaving-example
* Usually config files are load-time-weaving enabled (***needs to do more research***)

### Dynamic proxy JDK vs CGLib
* Proxy patten use case is for access control, such as auth, throttle, delegation, and not about changing behaviors
* Dynamic proxies differ from static proxies in a way that they do not exist at compile time. Instead, they are generated at runtime by the JDK and then made available to the users at runtime
* Spring AOP weaving use JDK dynamic proxy by default. It creates a proxy implements the interface of the target objects and delegate method calls (this requires target object implements an interface)
* CGlib creates proxy by subclassing (extends). Because of this, class or methods should not be final


### Tomcat, java EE, java servlet, and socket
* Apache tomcat is a web server and java servlet container (servlet engine)
* Apache tomcat is not directly built upon java ee, but java se (standard edition)
* However, most application build web application by deploying WAR (web application archive) onto tomcat servlet engine
* Servlet is simply a java class that deals with http request and gives http response
* Java servlet is not directly communicating with java socket. Instead, tomcat (servlet enginer) directly uses java socket listening to a port to establish network transmission
* Tomcat (servlet contain) manages java servlet lifecycles, dispatch requests into appropriate servlet. Servelet can generate HTML, execute logic, access DB and etc
* Java socket fits into transport layer in OSI model (layer 4), socket is a software object representing an IP + port number
* Port is a logical entity. Port, along with IP, uniquely identifies the destination (endpoint) for a data packets in network
