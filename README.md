### Sql vs NoSql
Structural query language (SQL) is a domain specific Lange(DSL) designed for relational database manage system (RDBMS)

Relational database bases on relational model of data, and was proposed by E.F.Codd in 1970. It was invented back than and fit well with the data access pattern.

Storage efficient was important as the cost was high (however, storage cost lowers as Moore's law), and online analysis processing was favoring a query engine that allows performer to look up data from any angles

Couple of comparisons

* Relational db provides structural data, and therefore reduces data duplication
* There are 5 level of normal forms, which help tp normalize data model in relational database
* Relational db allows data lookup from any angel, whereas NoSql lookup requires a pre-plan out for the data model based on access pattern
* NoSql db access data with a partition key, which tells where to find the data quickly therefore can be scaled up horizontally
* Partition key helps locate the physical data center. With a B+ tree, compute complexity is O(logn)
* Relational database is not easy to scale as JOIN operation is time expensive as size goes larger and larger
